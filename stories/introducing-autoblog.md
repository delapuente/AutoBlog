Introducing AutoBlog

<p>AutoBlog is a little JavaScript utility to build static blogs with minimum
server support.</p>
+++
<p>With AutoBlog you maintain folders called streams in the server and write
your stories in plain text inside the stream. Each stream must have an
index.json file with a list of published stories.</p>

<p>Inside a post you can use HTML to <b>format your entry</b>.</p>

<p>This is only a proof of concept of AutoBlog and several features are coming
soon.</p>
