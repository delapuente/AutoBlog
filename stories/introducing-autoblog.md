Introducing AutoBlog
AutoBlog is a little JavaScript utility to build static blogs with minimum
server support.
+++
With AutoBlog you maintain folders called streams in the server and write
your stories in plain text inside the stream. Each stream must have an
index.json file with a list of published stories.

Inside a post you can use Markdown to **format your entry**.

This is only a proof of concept of AutoBlog and several features are coming
soon.
