Implemented features
This is the list of implemented features:

 * Markdown support via [Showdown](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown).
 Just add Showdown to your `index.html` **before** including `autoblog.js`.

 * Custom templates by stream.
 Inside a stream you can add a custom html section marked with the attribute
 `data-template`. The HTML inside becomes your story template. Add the
 attributes `data-title`, `data-excerpt`, `data-body`, `data-author` or
 `data-date` to fill the element with the proper content. To ignore
 showing some content just omit the proper attribute.
